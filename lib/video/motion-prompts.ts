/**
 * Default motion prompts for video generation
 *
 * Best practices for real estate video prompts:
 * Structure: [Camera action] + [Direction/Speed] + [Distance/Framing] + [Subject focus] + [Style]
 *
 * Key principles:
 * - Use consistent motion language: "camera tracks", "camera pushes forward"
 * - Specify camera distance and framing for visual coherence
 * - Break complex movements into simpler instructions
 * - Avoid multiple simultaneous camera transformations
